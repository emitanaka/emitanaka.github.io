:::{#hero-heading}

:::

Hi there!

I'm an **academic** at the **Australian National University** (ANU) living in Canberra. I'm a **statistician** with a passion for **data science** and **open-source software**. I'm currently the **Deputy Director** at the [Biological Data Science Institute](https://bdsi.anu.edu.au/) and an **Executive Editor** of the [R Journal](https://journal.r-project.org/). I also have affiliation at the ANU [Research School of Finance, Actuarial Studies and Statistics](https://rsfas.anu.edu.au/), where I visit on a regular basis.  

My primary interest is to develop impactful methods and tools that can be readily used by practitioners. I enjoy working in collaborative environment with people from diverse backgrounds, with an aim to enhance our knowledge and understanding of the real world data. I interface across multiple disciplines to bridge statistical concepts and findings to a broad range of individuals. To this end, I have developed numerous open-source tools, primarily as R-packages, and resources aimed at making statistical methods accessible to a diverse audience. 

I take a proactive approach to community development. I'm actively involved in the Statistical Society of Australia (SSA), International Biometrics Society (Australasian Region) and other committees. I recently completed my term as President of the SSA Victorian Branch. My contributions have been recognised by the [SSA Distinguished Presenter's Award](https://www.statsoc.org.au/DistinguishedPresentersAwardRecipients), [SSA Leadership in Statistics](https://www.statsoc.org.au/News-and-media-releases/12887467) and featured on the list of [60 prominent Australian statisticians](https://significancemagazine.com/60-for-the-60th-celebrating-ssas-60th-anniversary/) in the Significance magazine.


My **research interests** are:

* [Experimental design]{.highlight-color},
* [Mixed models]{.highlight-color} (also known as multi-level models, panel data models or hierarchical models),
* [Data visualisation]{.highlight-color} and [visual inference]{.highlight-color},
* Applications in [bioinformatics]{.highlight-color} and [selective breeding]{.highlight-color} (particularly plant breeding),
* [Statistical software development]{.highlight-color}, particularly in R, and
* [Statistical workflow]{.highlight-color} (encompassing reproducibility, design, infrastructure and communication).

I speak **English**, **Japanese** (conversational) and **R** (base + tidyverse) fluently. I've lived in Australia almost all of my life (+-10 years standard deviation) and my university major was mathematics and statistics. Most of my code written during my PhD was in **Python** and **Bash** (both of which I am rusty now). I also like to dabble on front-end web development (**HTML/CSS/JS**). I've developed web apps using **Shiny** and practice computational reproducibility using **Git**, **R Markdown** (now **Quarto**) and internal DSLs (e.g. targets and renv R-packages). I'm a very data-oriented person to the extent that I've collected my own data via webscrapping and API. I adapt quickly and am quite open to taking new challenges -- occasionally, I do text analysis and play in machine learning competitions.


I am a big advocate of [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) and an avid [research software engineer](https://ukrse.github.io/who.html). My code are mostly available on my **GitHub** profile where I also host a number of R-packages that I have developed.
