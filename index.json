Model selection for LVMs has an additional striking twist: as the name suggests, the latent variables are unobserved and have to be estimated from the data. Therefore, we need to select both the order and the structure of the factor loadings, where the former involves choosing the number of latent variables. I introduce a method for order selection in LVMs known as the Ordered FActor Lasso (OFAL, Hui et al., 2018), which utilises penalised likelihood methods to encourage both element-wise and group-wise sparsity in the loadings. Specifically, we show how the OFAL penalty exploits both the grouped and hierarchical nature of the loadings, thus providing a natural approach to order selection, while also circumventing the issue of identifiability without the use of an arbitrary constraint and offering the potential for easier interpretability of the factor loadings. Additionally, I will discuss a computational algorithm for calculating the OFAL estimates based on a convenient reparameterisation of the penalty.","tags":["social"],"title":"Model selection and estimation for latent variable models","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Emi Tanaka"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546261200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546261200,"objectID":"ada30ea3057b6e4ee8a8ca734161e8dd","permalink":"/talk/rssds2019/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00+11:00","relpermalink":"/talk/rssds2019/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["social"],"title":"Software design for linear mixed model specification","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Emi Tanaka"],"categories":null,"content":"Special Topic Session organised by Mst Howlader Tamanna with other speakers:\n Louise M Ryan John Bailer Anil Gore  ","date":1546261200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546261200,"objectID":"3507e3c72df455979e989fadb7cc97a0","permalink":"/talk/2019-08-18-isiwsc2019/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00+11:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-08-18-isiwsc2019/","section":"talk","summary":"Today almost all organizations and institutions would have a social media channel for marketing and communications. Social media use, in particular with Twitter, is increasingly embraced by academics and professionals. Many conferences or events now come with a hashtag (a keyword preceded by a hash) that allows social media users to easily find relevant posts. Statisticians post jobs, report key findings, advertise for events or even have general chatters about work and life using social media.\nIn the past, interactions with other statisticians around the world were often limited to conferences. Social media has spawned communities that transcend space and hierarchy. One example is the Twitter #rstats community where many R users regularly share and interact with each other from all over the world with little regard for hierarchy and numerous celebrations for openness and sharing of knowledge.\nSocial media evolved rapidly and while its use is increasing, a large number of the statistical community are unaware of the vibrant community that lurks in this space.

The flexibility includes taking into account a hierarchical or correlated structure and the consideration of the different sources of variability. These complex structures can give rise to many different variance parameters. The estimation of variance components can be negative under certain methods and these have long been baffling to practitioners. These cases are sometimes unnoticeable due to the software‚Äôs inherent restriction for variance components to remain positive. In such a case, it is often that the variance components are close to the zero boundary. The occurrence of negative variances is attributed to a range of reasons. We present examples, based on agricultural experiments, of the occurrences of negative estimates of variance components and the consequences of ignoring random effects with negative variance components with respect to the aim of the analysis.","tags":["mixed-models"],"title":"Don't be so negative about negative estimates of variance components","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539781200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539781200,"objectID":"5349e744083bb746174e1b6ba6ed5fae","permalink":"/talk/2018-10-18-sums2018/","publishdate":"2018-10-18T00:00:00+11:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2018-10-18-sums2018/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["data-vis"],"title":"Statisitcal fallacy and storytelling via data visualisation","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1537279200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1537279200,"objectID":"c85c60ca01643deed4f0220451023071","permalink":"/talk/2018-10-18-radies-sydney-shiny/","publishdate":"2018-09-19T00:00:00+10:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2018-10-18-radies-sydney-shiny/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["data-vis"],"title":"Shiny September: Making an interactive web app with R","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1535551200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535551200,"objectID":"4585bd0f63af201895d1200b98680271","permalink":"/talk/2018-08-30-asc2018/","publishdate":"2018-08-30T00:00:00+10:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2018-08-30-asc2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Data visualisation is an area in statistical research conferences that is underrepresented or lacking in discussion despite its widespread use and its extensive power for storytelling.

You may like to save your own time by **downloading my powerpoint template** [here](hexsticker.pptx) as a base to make your own.","tags":[],"title":"Making a Hexagon Sticker","type":"post"},{"authors":["FKC Hui","E Tanaka","D Warton"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1519822800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519822800,"objectID":"bbb63ea873e31f5fb86fff80a5a1e82b","permalink":"/publication/2018-03-15-ofal/","publishdate":"2018-03-01T00:00:00+11:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2018-03-15-ofal/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["lasso","factor-analytic","latent-variable-model"],"title":"Order Selection and Sparsity in Latent Variable Models via the Ordered Factor LASSO","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E Tanaka","JPF Ral","S Li","R Gaire","CR Cavanagh","BR Cullis","A Whan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1512478800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512478800,"objectID":"cb3f77abfe4311e716c3b17bb37a839c","permalink":"/publication/2017-12-06-starch_mixture/","publishdate":"2017-12-06T00:00:00+11:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-12-06-starch_mixture/","section":"publication","summary":"The proportion of granule types in wheat starch is an important characteristic that can affect its functionality. It is widely accepted that granule types are either large, disc-shaped A-type granules or small, spherical B-type granules. Additionally, there are some reports of the tiny C-type granules. The differences between these granule types are due to its carbohydrate composition and crystallinity which is highly, but not perfectly, correlated with the granule size. A majority of the studies that have considered granule types analyse them based on a size threshold rather than chemical composition. This is understandable due to the expense of separating starch into different types. While the use of a size threshold to classify granule type is a low-cost measure, this results in misclassification. We present an alternative, statistical method to quantify the proportion of granule types by a fit of the mixture distribution, along with an R package, a web based app and a video tutorial for how to use the web app to enable its straightforward application.","tags":["wheat","mixture-distribution"],"title":"Increased accuracy of starch granule type quantification using mixture distributions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A Norman","J Taylor","E Tanaka","P Telfer","J Edwards","JP Martinant","H Kuchel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1512478800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512478800,"objectID":"4a047b763d16aee80447b6f2dd62a12e","permalink":"/publication/2017-09-08-genomic_prediction_agt/","publishdate":"2017-12-06T00:00:00+11:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-09-08-genomic_prediction_agt/","section":"publication","summary":"Genomic prediction accuracy within a large panel was found to be substantially higher than that previously observed in smaller populations, and also higher than QTL-based prediction. In recent years, genomic selection for wheat breeding has been widely studied, but this has typically been restricted to population sizes under 1000 individuals. To assess its efficacy in germplasm representative of commercial breeding programmes, we used a panel of 10,375 Australian wheat breeding lines to investigate the accuracy of genomic prediction for grain yield, physical grain quality and other physiological traits. To achieve this, the complete panel was phenotyped in a dedicated field trial and genotyped using a custom Axiom Affymetrix SNP array. A high-quality consensus map was also constructed, allowing the linkage disequilibrium present in the germplasm to be investigated. Using the complete SNP array, genomic prediction accuracies were found to be substantially higher than those previously observed in smaller populations and also more accurate compared to prediction approaches using a finite number of selected quantitative trait loci. Multi-trait genetic correlations were also assessed at an additive and residual genetic level, identifying a negative genetic correlation between grain yield and protein as well as a positive genetic correlation between grain size and test weight.","tags":["wheat","genomic-prediction"],"title":"Increased genomic prediction accuracy in wheat breeding using a large Australian panel","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1512133200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512133200,"objectID":"e6e3c85dd57de6ae809e8b78b47d3bf8","permalink":"/talk/rladies-shiny/","publishdate":"2017-12-02T00:00:00+11:00","relpermalink":"/talk/rladies-shiny/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Making a Shiny interactive web application using R","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Emi Tanaka","Francis K.

In plant breeding specifically, FA models provide a natural framework for parsimoniously modelling genotype x environment interactions, as often the number of environments can be relatively large compared to the number of genotypes and the elements of the FA model, e.g. specific factors, may have meaningful interpretation for the aim of the experiment, e.g. environmental specific genotype effects are not replicable in other environments and thus may not be of interest in the aim for selection.\nAn FA model is dictated to a large extent by the number of factors (the order of the model). A higher order leads to more parameters in the model, which necessitates that order selection be used to achieve parsimony while also ensuring that a sufficient number of factors is selected to flexibly model between-environment interactions. We introduce a new method for order selection in FA models known as the Ordered FActor Lasso (OFAL), which induces both element-wise and group-wise sparsity in the loadings. By exploiting both the grouped and hierarchical nature of the loadings, the OFAL penalty provides a natural approach to order selection, while also circumventing the issue of identifiability without use of an arbitrary constraint and offering the potential for easier interpretability of the factor loadings. We compare its performance based on a simulation motivated from a real wheat yield multi-environmental trial.","tags":["factor-analytic","GxE"],"title":"Order selection of factor analytic models for genotype x environment interaction","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483966800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483966800,"objectID":"c524b83ad22da9f06d67ac5411854c5a","permalink":"/talk/2018-08-28-asc2018/","publishdate":"2017-01-10T00:00:00+11:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2018-08-28-asc2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Linear mixed models are widely used across many disciplines due to its flexibility to model many complex data. The flexibility includes taking into account a hierarchical or correlated structure and the consideration of the different sources of variability. These complex structures can give rise to many different variance parameters. The estimation of variance components can be negative under certain methods and these have long been baffling to practitioners. These cases are sometimes unnoticeable due to the software?s inherent restriction for variance components to remain positive. In such a case, it is often that the variance components are close to the zero boundary. The occurrence of negative variances is attributed to a range of reasons. We present examples, based on agricultural experiments, of the occurrences of negative estimates of variance components and the consequences of ignoring random effects with negative variance components with respect to the aim of the analysis.","tags":["mixed-model"],"title":"Don't be so negative about negative estimates of variance components","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461679200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461679200,"objectID":"14184066c2fd108818662159ec088aaf","permalink":"/project/statistical-bioinformatics/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+10:00","relpermalink":"/project/statistical-bioinformatics/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["applied-statistics","bioinformatics"],"title":"Statistical Bioinformatics","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461679200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461679200,"objectID":"3481e643049b914be839fdea6fc1ee97","permalink":"/project/statistical-computing/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+10:00","relpermalink":"/project/statistical-computing/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["applied-statistics","statistcal-computing"],"title":"Statistical Computing","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461679200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461679200,"objectID":"f94f792d5878e1c26bb7b159dfb056bd","permalink":"/project/statistical-literacy/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+10:00","relpermalink":"/project/statistical-literacy/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["applied-statistics","statistical-literacy"],"title":"Statistical Literacy","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461679200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461679200,"objectID":"1ba6a44052c646972975245473ed14ae","permalink":"/project/statistical-methods/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+10:00","relpermalink":"/project/statistical-methods/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["applied-statistics","statistical-methods"],"title":"Statistical Methods","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461679200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461679200,"objectID":"53adc60049338e3182fe8b12d4890b1a","permalink":"/project/statistics-for-grains-industry/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+10:00","relpermalink":"/project/statistics-for-grains-industry/","section":"project","summary":"","tags":["applied-statistics","statistics-for-grains-industry"],"title":"Statistics for the Grains Industry","type":"project"},{"authors":["E Tanaka","T Bailey","U Keich"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1395579600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1395579600,"objectID":"4d60f98883ee8491075fba386a229f7c","permalink":"/publication/2014-03-24-motif_sig/","publishdate":"2014-03-24T00:00:00+11:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2014-03-24-motif_sig/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["motif"],"title":"Improving MEME via a two-tiered significance analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["E Tanaka","T Bailey","C E Grant","W S Noble","U Keich"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1304431200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1304431200,"objectID":"e5ae92491201bad9ebc3b870884951ef","permalink":"/publication/2011-05-04-motif_comparison/","publishdate":"2011-05-04T00:00:00+10:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2011-05-04-motif_comparison/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["motif"],"title":"Improved similarity scores for comparing motifs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["I Liachko","E Tanaka","K Cox","S C C Chung","L Yang","A Seher","L Hallas","E Cha","G Kang","H Pace","J Barrow","M Inada","B Tye","U Keich"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1304431200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1304431200,"objectID":"d08b36cf8e8fafe24e7f59533439483e","permalink":"/publication/2011-12-28-ars_selection/","publishdate":"2011-05-04T00:00:00+10:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2011-12-28-ars_selection/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["yeast"],"title":"Novel features of ARS selection in budding yeast Lachancea kluyveri","type":"publication"}]
