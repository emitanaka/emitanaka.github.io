    "text": "Shortcut for div and span with CSS classes\nxaringan\nIn xaringan, div element with content, say “My content.”, and CSS class, say myclass, are created with\n.myclass[\nMy content.\n]\nThe above when processed by remark.js becomes:\n<div class=\"myclass\">\nMy content.\n</div>\nSimilary for span element, the shortcut in xaringan is:\n.myclass[My content.]\nwhich becomes\n<span class=\"myclass\">My content.</span>\nThe difference between the two being that there is a new line required before the ] for the div element.\nQuarto revealjs\nIn Quarto revealjs slides, the shortcut for the div and span elements are (I believe) from native Pandoc divs and spans. This was actually one of the biggest reasons I wanted to switch from xaringan. All Rmd documents support Pandoc divs and spans except in xaringan where the markdown content is processed by remark.js instead of Pandoc. The lack of consistency even made me write my own naive javascript to mimic Pandoc div and span for xaringan, but I still wanted the native support.\nSo you can create a div element in Quarto revealjs by:\n::: myclass\n\nMy content.\n\n:::\nor equivalently,\n::: {.myclass}\n\nMy content.\n\n:::\nIn fact, it’s not limited to CSS classes but ids as well. E.g.\n::: {#myid}\n\nMy content.\n\n:::\nis the same as\n<div id=\"myid\">\nMy content.\n</div>\nFor a span element in Quarto revealjs, it will be like below\n[My content.]{.myclass}\nwhere this is equivalent to below:\n<span class=\"myclass\">My content.</span>"

    "text": "Slide CSS classes\nxaringan\nIn xaringan, a CSS class maybe specified to the whole slide by:\nclass: myclass\nI used this sometimes to define a slide with different background colors.\nQuarto revealjs\nThe HTML layout for revealjs slides is actually quite different to the layout for remarkjs slides. I won’t go into too much details this time, but the main thing is that a slide content is written within <section></section> and separate to this is a background element and other div (like footer and slide numbers). The latter elements are not nested within the slide itself, which makes the concept of applying the CSS class to the whole slide different in revealjs compared to xaringan/remarkjs.\nTo apply a CSS class to a slide with no title, you can do below:\n## {.myclass}\nand if you have a title, just write the title first before defining the class like below:\n## My title {.myclass}\nIf you want to apply it to the slide background then only specific attributes work, e.g. below changes the background color of the slide to red:\n## {background-color=\"red\"}"

E.g.\nSlide 1 \n\n--\n\n{{content}}\n\nThis content will only appear in next slide below \"Slide 1\".\n\n--\n\nThis content will appear on top of the last sentence but below \"Slide 1\".\n\nQuarto revealjs\nThe -- in xaringan is the same as the . . . (three dots separated by spaces) in Quarto revealjs.\n\nSlide 1 \n\nFirst content\n\n. . . \n\nSecond content after pause\n\nA similar feat to {{content}} in xaringan can be achieved by using fragments in Quarto revealjs, like below:\n\nSlide 1 \n\n::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}\nThis content will appear on top of the last sentence but below \"Slide 1\".\n:::\n\n::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}\nThis content will only appear in next slide below \"Slide 1\".\n:::\n\nYou can find more details here but the basic idea is that any HTML elements that have the class “fragment” will be incrementally shown and you can control the sequence of appearance by specifying the number for the attribute in fragment-index.\nThis is of course painful to do if you have a list! For this, there is a special case where incremental lists can be specified by class “incremental” like below:\n::: {.incremental}\n- Task A\n- Task B\n:::\nMore details on incremental list can be found here."
