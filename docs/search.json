My primary interest is to develop impactful methods and tools that can be readily used by practitioners. I interface across multiple disciplines to bridge statistical concepts and findings to a broad range of individuals. To this end, I have developed numerous open-source tools, primarily as R-packages, and resources aimed at making statistical methods accessible to a diverse audience. I demonstrate a proactive approach to community development through my involvement in different positions within the branches of the Statistical Society of Australia (SSA) and other committees.\nMy research interests are:\nI speak English, Japanese (conversational) and R (base + tidyverse) fluently. I’ve lived in Australia almost all of my life (+-10 years standard deviation) and my university major was mathematics and statistics. My PhD, obtained at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Sydney in 2015, is in statistical bioinformatics with most of my code written in Python and Bash (both of which I am rusty now). I also like to dabble on front-end web development (HTML/CSS/JS). I’ve developed web apps using Shiny and practice computational reproducibility using Git, R Markdown (now Quarto) and internal DSLs (e.g. targets and renv R-packages). I’m a very data-oriented person to the extent that I’ve collected my own data via webscrapping and API. I adapt quickly and am quite open to taking new challenges – occasionally, I do text analysis and play in machine learning competitions.\nI am a big advocate of open science and an avid research software engineer. My code are mostly available on my GitHub profile where I also host a number of R-packages that I have developed."

    "text": "A sequence diagram, as described in wikipedia, shows objects interactions arranged in time sequence. One of the standards for drawing this is using the Unified Modelling Language (UML) managed by the Object Management Group (OMG).\nUML was developed in the field of software engineering to provide a standard way to visualise the design of a system. It’s a language that describes standards for all sorts of diagrams, not just the sequence diagram, e.g. communication diagram, interaction overview diagram and so on.\nThe interaction of actors with the system depicted as objects with passage of time depicted as a vertical dotted line (a.k.a. lifeline) seemed like a good fit to use for illustrating the concept of edibble."

I found several online mapping solutions including Lucidchart and Visual Paradigm but it wasn’t what I was after. Eventually I came across GitMind. It was the most promising to me: it has a nice user interface, the features that I want and it happened to be completely free! It was easier than OmniGraffle to make sequence diagrams. You can find the result of the drawing in Figure @ref(fig:gitmind).\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawn using GitMind.\n\n\n\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that the font for the PDF version is not rendered correctly. This is perhaps I’ve chosen a font available only in my system (“Fira Code”).\nOkay, looks like I’m good with this. Let’s use this in the edibble documentation… Wait the interaction between the statisitican and Design doesn’t fit the narrative well, I need to modify the diagram again!\nThis was a point when I realise I really need to programmatically create the diagram. Being somewhat of an anti click-and-point statistical software, I should have perhaps pursued the programmatic route earlier."

    "text": "R\nThe most comprehensive R-package to draw a diagram is DiagrammeR. When you go to the website (which has an impressively interface) it has the tagline “Sometimes You Want To Create Nice Diagrams: WHY NOT DO THAT WITH R?”. That’s a good question to ask past Emi.\n\nDiagrammeR\nUnder the hood, DiagrammeR it’s powered by Graphviz and mermaid. Sequence diagrams are supported by mermaid but there seems to be no distinguishment between an actor and an object. It seems like you always have to a message when actor/object is interacting.\n\nDiagrammeR::mermaid(\"\nsequenceDiagram\n    domain expert-&gt;&gt;statistician: consult\n    statistician--&gt;&gt;domain expert: query\n    statistician-&gt;&gt;Design: start_design()\n    statistician-&gt;&gt;Design: set_units()\")\n\n\n\nDrawn using mermaid via DiagrammeR\n\n\nIt’s fairly good and you can further customise the look using CSS, but it doesn’t have the actor symbol and some other standard UML symbols, it will be too much effort by me to recreate what I made using GitMind.\n\n\nnomnoml\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawn using nomnoml.com\n\n\n\n\nThe nomnoml R-package describes itself as a Sassy UML Diagrams for R. It’s powered by the nomnoml tool which has a nice simple website to create the diagrams you want. I quite enjoy using the website version where the graph renders instantenously using a simple syntax. The graph made using the web (Figure @ref(fig:nomnoml)) is different to the one produced via R shown below along with the nomnoml syntax.\n\n[&lt;actor&gt;domain expert] -- [&lt;hidden&gt; fin1]\n[&lt;actor&gt;statistician] -- [&lt;hidden&gt; fin2]\n[design] -- [&lt;end&gt; end]\n[&lt;database&gt; data] -- [&lt;hidden&gt; hid]\n[&lt;actor&gt;technician] -- [&lt;hidden&gt; fin3]\n\n\n\nDrawn using nomnoml\n\n\nIt turns out thought that the nomnoml doesn’t support sequence diagrams and it doesn’t look like it will support it any time either.\n\n\nplantuml\nI came across another R-package for UML diagrams called plantuml. It’s powered by the the plantUML tool which has a extensive support for a sequence diagram (yes!).\nThis one is not on CRAN yet. I initially had trouble getting it to work but managed to work re-installing GraphViz. I could get the example code to work but the code for sequence diagram didn’t work for me so I used the online version of plantUML directly.\nI expanded a lot more than previous graphs with plantUML code below. The problem I realise now is that the image has become too big and too much text to be concise. So I’ll have to tweak some more (when does this end?).

This could be that a scientist may wish to test their hypothesis, a manufacturer wants to know which manufacturing process is better or a researcher wants to understand some cause-and-effect relationships. A characteristic part of an experiment is that the experimenter has control over some explanatory variables. In a comparative experiment, the control is over the allocation of treatments to subjects. Designing an experiment in the statistics discipline usually focus on this allocation, although it’s important to keep in mind that there are other decision factors in an experiment.\nData that are collected from experiments are what we refer to as experimental data. Because it was collected with some objective in mind followed by some data collection plan, experimental data are often thought of to be better quality than observational data. But then again if you can’t quantify the quality of data, you can’t really tell. Certain scientific claims (e.g. causation, better treatment) can only be substantiated by experiments and so experimental data is held to a higher standard in general."

You might then wonder if that’s the case words like “design of” or “of experiments” should make an appearance, however “of” is a stop word and these are filtered out otherwise unwanted bigrams come up on the top.\nThere are couple of words like “clinical trial” and “dose finding” that suggests applications in medical experiments, as well as “microarray experiment” that suggests application in bioinformatics.\n\n\n\nThe bigram of the R-package _titles_ as provided in the DESCRIPTION file in CRAN.\n\n\nBigram\nCount\n\n\n\n\nexperimental design\n6\n\n\noptimal design\n6\n\n\nclinical trial\n5\n\n\ndose finding\n5\n\n\nsequential design\n5\n\n\nblock design\n4\n\n\nmicroarray experiment\n4\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe title alone might be too succinct for text analysis so I also had a look at the most common bigrams in the description of the DoE packages as shown in Table @ref(tab:bigram-desc).

To be more clear, even if the bigram is mentioned multiple times within the description, it’s only counted once per package. This removes the inflation of the counts due to one package mentioning the same bigram over and over again.\nAgain not surprisingly “experimental design” and “optimal design” comes on top in the DoE package descriptions.

The download counts are the raw values and these include downloads by CRAN mirror and bots. There is a noticeable spike when there is an update to the CRAN package. This is partly because when there is a new version of the package, when you install other packages that depend or import it then R will prompt you to install the new version. This means that the download counts are inflated and to some extent you can artificially boost them by making regular CRAN updates. The adjustedcranlogs (Morgan-Wall 2017) makes a nice attempt to adjust the raw counts based on a certain heuristic. I didn’t use it since the adjustment is stochastic and I appear to have hit a bug.\n\n\npkg_url &lt;- \"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/{pkg}/index.html\"\npkg_archive &lt;- \"https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/{pkg}/\"\npkg_updates &lt;- map(top5, function(pkg) {\n    last_update &lt;- read_html(glue(pkg_url)) %&gt;% \n      html_table() %&gt;% \n      .[[1]] %&gt;% \n      filter(X1==\"Published:\") %&gt;% \n      pull(X2) %&gt;% \n      ymd()\n      \n    archive_dates &lt;- tryCatch({ \n        read_html(glue(pkg_archive)) %&gt;% \n          html_table() %&gt;%\n          .[[1]] %&gt;% \n          pull(`Last modified`) %&gt;% \n          ymd_hm() %&gt;% \n          na.omit() %&gt;% \n          as.Date()\n      }, error = function(e) {\n        NULL\n      })\n    c(archive_dates, last_update)\n  })\nnames(pkg_updates) &lt;- top5\n\nupdates &lt;- unlist(pkg_updates) %&gt;% \n  enframe(\"package\", \"update\") %&gt;% \n  # unlist converts date to integers\n  mutate(update = as.Date(update, origin = \"1970-01-01\"),\n         # need to get rid of the numbers appended to pkg names\n         package = str_extract(package, paste0(top5, collapse=\"|\")),\n         package = factor(package, levels = top5)) %&gt;% \n  filter(between(update, start, end))\n\n\n\n\nggplot(top5_df, aes(date, count, color = package)) +\n  # add shadow lines\n  geom_line(data = rename(top5_df, package2 = package), \n            color = \"gray\", aes(group = package2)) +\n  # add date when package was updated\n  geom_vline(data = updates, aes(xintercept = update),\n             linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"#79003e\") + \n  # the trend line\n  geom_line() +\n  scale_y_log10() +\n  facet_grid(package ~ .) + \n  labs(title = glue(\"Top 5 downloaded DoE packages from {start} to {end}\")) + \n  scale_color_discrete_qualitative() +\n  guides(color = FALSE) +\n  myggtheme\n\n\n(ref:timeplot) The above plot shows the daily downloads of the top 5 downloaded DoE packages from the period 2017-09-18 to 2022-09-16.

packages. The API of the packages are quite distinct. The object that it outputs can vary from a matrix to a list. DoE might be a dull area for many but it’s quite important for the downstream analysis. Perhaps if many of us talk more about it, it may help invigorate the area!"

There are currently information on 13,951 anime of which 91% originated from Japan.\nAs an anime lover, I’ve watched over 700 anime (which is still less than 5% in the whole database!) but one thing I noticed over recent years is that some anime titles are bizzarely long… or more like anime titles are becoming sentences. To explore this, I decided to use the anidb R-package to look at the data.\nFirst note that anime titles come in many forms. For example,\n\n“新世紀エヴァンゲリオン” is the Japanese title,\n“Shinseiki Evangelion” is the primary title (the official title in the country of origin but in romanized form), and\n“Neon Genesis Evangelion” is the English title. The English title may be unavailable if the anime is not licensed for English audiences.\n\nIn the following explorations, I use the primary title.\nFigure @ref(fig:title-length-distribution) shows that the distribution of the primary title length. We can see that most anime titles are less than 70 characters but there are some Japanese anime title that are double this length. The top 25 animes have title length greater than 107 characters.\n\n\nggplot(db, aes(ntitle)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = \"#79003e\") +\n  labs(x = \"The length of the romanised primary anime title by county of origin\", \n       y = \"Count\") + \n  facet_grid(origin ~ ., scales = \"free_y\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle length of Japanese anime are right skewed.\n\n\n\n\nThe five longest titles from longest to shortest are:\n\n“Honzuki no Gekokujou: Shisho ni Naru Tame ni wa Shudan o Erande Iraremasen - Eustachius no Shitamachi Sennyuu Daisakusen / Corinna-sama no Otaku Houmon”\n“Buta no Gotoki Sanzoku ni Torawarete Shojo o Ubawareru Kyonyuu Himekishi & Onna Senshi: Zettai Chinpo Nanka ni Maketari Shinai!! The Animation”\n“Yahari Ore no Seishun LoveCome wa Machigatte Iru. Kochira to Shite mo Karera Kanojora no Yukusue ni Sachi Ookaran Koto o Negawazaru o Enai.”\n“Yuusha ni Narenakatta Ore wa Shibushibu Shuushoku o Ketsui Shimashita.: Yuusha ni Narenakatta Ore no Imouto ga Joukyou Shite Kimashita.”\n“Dungeon ni Deai o Motomeru no wa Machigatte Iru Darouka: Familia Myth - Dungeon ni Onsen o Motomeru no wa Machigatte Iru Darouka”\n\n\n\ninfo &lt;- anime_info(as.character(dbl$aid)) %&gt;% \n  left_join(dbl, by = \"aid\")\n\n\nBecause of AniDB’s limit on API call (multiple requests can get you banned easily – turns out that the limit is quite small; about 13-14 calls already got me banned…), I’m going to just study the top 25 anime in terms of title length.\nFigure @ref(fig:release-date) suggest that super long titles are more common in the last decade than in the past. But the analysis is only based on top 25 anime with the longest titles so it could benefit from more extensive study.\n\n\nggplot(info, aes(start_date, ntitle)) + \n  geom_point(color = \"#79003e\") + \n  labs(x = \"Start date\", y = \"Title length\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 25 anime in terms of title length. Looks like super long titles occur more in the last decade. Top 6 anime with the longest titles are all released after 2010."

But let’s say now we create a function that returns the first element of the first dimension.\n\nindex_first &lt;- function(x) {\n  x[1, , ]\n}\n\nindex_first(x)\n\n     [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]\n[1,]    1    7   13   19\n[2,]    4   10   16   22\n\ny &lt;- array(1, dim = c(2, 4, 2))\nindex_first(y)\n\n     [,1] [,2]\n[1,]    1    1\n[2,]    1    1\n[3,]    1    1\n[4,]    1    1\n\n\nThe above function works fine for the arrays x and y. But what if the number of dimension is different?\n\nz &lt;- array(dim = c(2, 2, 2, 2))\nindex_first(z)\n\nError in x[1, , ]: incorrect number of dimensions\n\n\nSo how do we change our function so it works for an array of any number of dimensions? This is where it gets quite challenging. And while I’m at it, let me throw another challenge.\n\n\nChallenge 2: assignment\nSuppose now I want a function that modifies the entries in the first element of the first dimension by a user supplied value.\n\nmodify_first &lt;- function(x, value) {\n  x[1, ,] &lt;- value\n}\n\n\nmodify_first(x, NA)\nmodify_first(x, array(1:8, dim = c(2, 4)))\n\nAgain this works fine until we have an array with different number of dimensions.\n\nmodify_first(z, 1)\n\nError in x[1, , ] &lt;- value: incorrect number of subscripts\n\n\nSo how would you modify the function so this can be generalised for arrays with a different number of dimensions?"

There are now over 1.3 million people who have fled Ukraine since the Russian invasion, many who would be living as refugees now in neighboring countries. The closest to war I have ever been is when the Japanese embassy told (warned?) my family to get out of Jordan during the Gulf War. We lived in Greece during this period.\nWhen I lived in Greece, I was a young child with little comprehension of what’s going on. In the course of my life, this event had little effect on me but just a distant hazy memory. Today as a fully grown adult, I’m sure I would have been terrified being in the midst of uncertainty. War affects many citizens, including the creator of Leaflet as pointed out by Hiroaki Yutani-san. If ever you need a time to remind yourself how lucky you are to have shelter, food and water, now is probably the time.\nLiving in Melbourne, so far away from Ukraine, life is going on like normal, bickering over first world problems. What good is in a war? If you are in a good position to, please consider helping those in need. I donated US$500 to Ukraine Red Cross Society but I found later that there was the Ukraine Crisis Appeal in the Australian Red Cross."

If you didn’t that’s okay. Let’s instead look at Figure @ref(fig:mht-2007-bar) which shows the frequency of the birth month that the players are born. Now do you notice something?\n\nmht2007 %&gt;% \n  mutate(month = factor(month(Birthdate), levels = 1:12, labels = month.abb)) %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(month)) +\n  geom_bar(fill = \"#79003e\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(limits = month.abb) +\n  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0))\n\n\n\n\nThe barplot of the birth month of the Medicine Hat Tigers 2007 hockey players.\n\n\n\n\nWithout doing any statistical tests, you probably can see from Figure @ref(fig:mht-2007-bar) that there is an over-representation of players born in January. Gladwell postulates that this is a result of Canada’s eligibility cut-off for age-class hockey being January 1st. To explain further, coaches in Canada start training selected children at the age of 9 or 10. In preadolescence, a few months of gap can show a big difference in physical maturity, so for children born in the same year, the coaches tend to select the ones born earlier in the year. These selected children then get many more practice than the children who are not selected, and what started as a frivolous difference due to the month you were born turns into a big difference in talent in future.\nI wanted to validate the claim about the birth month so I searched and scraped the player data at Medicine Hot Tiger from https://tigershockey.com/roster/ using RSelenium and rvest packages. The resulting data is stored in the object roster which include the player information for the following games:\n\nroster %&gt;% \n  pull(WHL) %&gt;% \n  unique()\n\n [1] \"2021 - 22 Regular Season\" \"2021 Pre Season\"         \n [3] \"2020 - 21 Regular Season\" \"2019 - 20 Regular Season\"\n [5] \"2019 Pre Season\"          \"2019 WHL Playoffs\"       \n [7] \"2018 - 19 Regular Season\" \"2018 Pre Season\"         \n [9] \"2018 WHL Playoffs\"        \"2017 - 18 Regular Season\"\n[11] \"2017 Pre Season\"          \"2017 WHL Playoffs\"       \n[13] \"2016 - 17 Regular Season\" \"2016 Pre Season\"         \n[15] \"16 Tie Break\"             \"2015-16 Regular Season\"  \n[17] \"2015 Preseason\"           \"2015 WHL Playoffs\"       \n[19] \"2014-15 Regular Season\"   \"2014 Preseason\"          \n[21] \"2014 WHL Playoffs\"        \"2013-14 Regular Season\"  \n[23] \"2013 WHL Preseason\"       \"2013 WHL Playoffs\"       \n[25] \"2012-13 Regular Season\"   \"2012 WHL Preseason\"      \n[27] \"2012 WHL Playoffs\"        \"2011-12 Regular Season\"  \n[29] \"2011 WHL Preseason\"       \"2011 WHL Playoffs\"       \n[31] \"2010-11 Regular Season\"   \"2010 WHL Playoffs\"       \n[33] \"2009-10 Regular Season\"   \"2009 WHL Playoffs\"       \n[35] \"2008-09 Regular Season\"   \"2008 WHL Playoffs\"       \n[37] \"2007-08 Regular Season\"   \"2007 WHL Playoffs\"       \n[39] \"2006-07 WHL Season\"       \"2006 WHL Playoffs\"       \n[41] \"2005-06 WHL Season\"       \"2005 WHL Playoffs\"       \n[43] \"2004-05 WHL Season\"       \"2004 WHL Playoffs\"       \n[45] \"2003-2004 WHL Season\"     \"2003 WHL Playoffs\"       \n[47] \"2002-03 WHL Season\"       \"2001-2002 WHL Season\"    \n[49] \"2000-2001 WHL Season\"     \"1999-2000 WHL Season\"    \n[51] \"1998-99 WHL Season\"       \"1997-98 WHL Season\"      \n[53] \"1997 WHL Playoffs\"        \"1996-97 WHL Season\"      \n[55] \"1996 WHL Playoffs\"       \n\n\nAfter removing duplicate records of the players that appear across multiple games, I plot the frequency of the birth month of the rostered Medicine Hat Tigers hockey players from 1996 to 2021 in Figure @ref(fig:roster-bar).

Sadly, Gladwell didn’t take the opportunity to discuss about “women outliers” or highlight an example about success based on sex, which very much like birth month is a random assignment beyond an individual’s control, but can make a difference in one’s career.\nGladwell’s writing cemented the idea within me of the importance of the environment particularly when you are still young. E.g. if you are busy trying to find a safe place for you and your family because of the Ukraine-Russia war, you’ll have little opportunity to do anything else no matter how great of a talent you have.\nThose who are “successful” tend to be the ones who had the environment working in their favour earlier (if not most of the time) in their career. This is not to say they don’t have talent or didn’t work hard, but the tragedy in all this is that those who have talent but didn’t have the environment to achieve their maximum potential. I can see the traces of my thought on twitter about changing the environment if it’s not working for you creeping up every now and then. (Changing environments has costs though so I realise my advice doesn’t work for everyone.)\n\n\nYes this happens a lot. If you an ECR, it’s best to get out of that environment. You are young and it’s the best time to GROW. Surround yourself with people who are better in the skills you care about. If they are not in your workplace, go outside of workplace. Meetup, online\n\n— Emi Tanaka (田中愛美) 💉💉💉 (@statsgen) March 7, 2019\n\n\n\n\nIf you are the solo RSE or you don’t have anyone to talk deeply about the software engineering aspects, I don’t know if there will be motivation to stay in that kind of environment when you have other choices. (2/2)\n\n— Emi Tanaka (田中愛美) 💉💉💉 (@statsgen) November 17, 2021\n\nAbove predicates on the goal of personal growth, but “success” ultimately comes in many forms. Personally, I feel frustrated when I feel that the environment gets in my way of my personal growth and this tends to drive me to change the environment. There’s a limit to what you can change though, and there’s a part of me that knows that I’m driving myself into a wall getting frustrated at every turn and I’ve got to chill. (I’m sorry if you’re ever on the receiving end of my frustration - but hey maybe you deserve it!… I kid :P)\n\n\nChanging the environment for others’ growth\nThere’s been a few times in my life where the upper management was quite bad that it was causing havoc for those under the management and there is widespread discontent. Every time this happens, I always think about how I don’t want to be like that upper management, but I equally fear that I am going to be, perhaps unknowingly, like that when I’m in the same position. So I occasionally remind myself that I shouldn’t fault people, when you don’t know what other things are driving the behaviour or decision. But I’m no saint, so I still have a long way to go though to be that understanding and I might poke fun of the situation in a passive-aggressive drawing 🎨\n\n\nFun to draw again 💃 pic.twitter.com/3uHQLi8biA\n\n— Emi Tanaka (田中愛美) 💉💉💉 (@statsgen) February 18, 2019\n\n\n\n\nBranding and management gone wrong. \"Precision Pen\" pic.twitter.com/SVd6uyxrSr\n\n— Emi Tanaka (田中愛美) 💉💉💉 (@statsgen) March 17, 2019"

    "text": "Triangle test\n\nFor the triangle test there are six possible triplets involving the two products (labelled N and S for normal and spiked vegemite respectively), namely: NNS, SNN, NSN, SSN, NSS and SNS. Two of these triplets were presented in sequence to each consumer and so an optimal row–column design was constructed for six treatments (triplets) in two rows (order of presentation) and 42 columns (consumers)… if the consumer received a triplet with two of the normal vegemite then the second triplet would contain two of the spiked vegemite. Separate randomisations of the design were used for 2 days.\n\nRecall:\n\neach consumer taste no more than 12 samples of vegemite\nlogistics allow only 42 consumers per day\n\nAs every consumer also does the monadic test which uses 6 samples, only 6 samples remain for the triangle test. The product lineups took me a while to figure it out – the part that tripped me up was that the two lineups (out of NNS, SNN, NSN, SSN, NSS and SNS) that was presented to the consumer sequentially had to have the major product swapped, so you can’t choose something like NNS and NSN because both lineups have the major product as N. This precludes from just two random selections from NNS, SNN, NSN, SSN, NSS and SNS, and requires a conditional randomisation.\nI decided to think of this as a two step process:\n\nchoose the main product, and\nchoose out of the sequences XXO, XOX and OXX where X denotes the major product.\n\nSince the product lineup is nested within the consumer, the major product allocation in edibble below automatically treats consumer as a block and in the assignment, it will try to ensure the major product is different in the two lineups for each consumer.\n\ndes2 &lt;- design(\"triangle test\") %&gt;% \n    set_units(day = c(1, 4),\n              consumer = nested_in(day, 42),\n              product_lineup = nested_in(consumer, 2)) %&gt;% \n    set_trts(major_product = c(\"spiked\", \"normal\"),\n             sequence = c(\"XXO\", \"XOX\", \"OXX\")) %&gt;% \n    allot_table(major_product ~ product_lineup,\n                     sequence ~ product_lineup)\n\ndes2\n\n# triangle test \n# An edibble: 168 x 5\n         day   consumer   product_lineup major_product sequence\n   &lt;unit(2)&gt; &lt;unit(84)&gt;      &lt;unit(168)&gt;      &lt;trt(2)&gt; &lt;trt(3)&gt;\n 1         1  consumer1 product_lineup1         normal      XOX\n 2         1  consumer1 product_lineup2         spiked      OXX\n 3         1  consumer2 product_lineup3         normal      XOX\n 4         1  consumer2 product_lineup4         spiked      OXX\n 5         1  consumer3 product_lineup5         normal      XXO\n 6         1  consumer3 product_lineup6         spiked      XOX\n 7         1  consumer4 product_lineup7         spiked      XXO\n 8         1  consumer4 product_lineup8         normal      XOX\n 9         1  consumer5 product_lineup9         normal      OXX\n10         1  consumer5 product_lineup10        spiked      XOX\n# … with 158 more rows\n# ℹ Use `print(n = ...)` to see more rows\n\n\nI could alternatively design the above as a row-column design.\n\ndes2alt &lt;- design(\"triangle test\") %&gt;% \n    set_units(day = c(1, 4),\n              consumer = nested_in(day, 42),\n              order = 2,\n              product_lineup = crossed_by(consumer, order)) %&gt;% \n    set_trts(major_product = c(\"spiked\", \"normal\"),\n             sequence = c(\"XXO\", \"XOX\", \"OXX\")) %&gt;% \n    allot_table(major_product ~ product_lineup,\n                     sequence ~ product_lineup)\n\ndeggust::autoplot(des2alt)"

    "text": "After being office-less for 10 days (technically 4 days not counting public holidays and weekends), many of us in the Menzies building have safely moved yesterday to our temporary offices in Building 6 while Menzies undergo renovations for the next 2+ years (anyone wanna bet it’ll take more than 2 years or not?).\nMy old office had a pretty nice view of the hex wall but I don’t know where it is now. Last I saw it was clearly labelled to be moved to level 3 corridors but maybe it’s yet to be moved. Impressively, they did manage to bring my big and small whiteboard as well as the large corkboard in my old office – now it just needs to be hanged and I need to figure out where the whiteboard markers are stored.\n\n\nYou should check out the view of the corridor from my office ;) pic.twitter.com/8L0fCf6F0P\n\n— Emi Tanaka (田中愛美) 💉💉💉 ((statsgen?)) August 1, 2020\n\n\nWhile that’s happening, in the weekends I saw some twitter posts (yet again) about shade against academia. The specific post was referring to the lower pay in academia and said in industry there’s no penalty in walking away from a job with bad work culture (insinuating that’s not the case in academia). Give it another week or so, I’m sure I’ll see another post against the academic culture, a #quitlit post or how great an industry position is.\nBased on the frequency you see these posts, you’d think academia is an awful place. It’s also not hard to find people who’ll affirm your belief. Then why do people stay in academia? There’s one reason I hear quite often – they get freedom. That answer always remind me of a page from this book I saw years ago – this page still makes me laugh 😂\n\nThere’s a well known experimental study by L. Festinger and Carlsmith (1959) that studied subjects that had to do repetitive, monotonous tasks and was told to lie to the next “subject” (actually a hired accomplice) that the task was interesting and enjoyable. Some subjects were paid $1 for lying while others were paid $20. There was a control group that didn’t have to lie. There were 20 subjects in each of the three groups. After the task, each subject was asked to rate (on a scale of -5 to +5 where -5 is dislike, and +5 is like) how much they enjoyed the tasks. The subjects that were paid $1 reported on average a higher level of enjoyment (1.35) than subjects who were paid $20 (-0.50); the average level of enjoyment for control group was -0.45.\nThe results aligned with the theory of cognitive dissonance by Leon Festinger (1957), which suggests that we have an inner drive to hold our cognitive elements (attitudes, perceptions, knowledge and beliefs) in harmony and we feel discomfort when some of these elements are inconsistent. The study by L. Festinger and Carlsmith (1959) suggested that people who were paid $1 to lie felt they had to justify the poor payment by convincing themselves that they actually enjoyed the task, while those that were paid $20 were well rewarded and did not experience cognitive dissonance.\nThe experimental result in L. Festinger and Carlsmith (1959) reminded me of the often touted reason where industry is better than academia: money, and the academics that give reasons of why they stay in academia, despite the lower pay. If you are an academic, did you really choose to be in academia for some higher purpose? Or do you just stay because we tend to succumb to inertia and that was the path of least resistance? I tend to be skeptical of any rosy picture that either side presents. I don’t deny though that I get affected by the strong emotions that people display against academia – more so, because I know some comments are true – academic culture and system needs to improve – but the eternal question is who’s going to champion the change? The way I see it, it’s a collective responsibility so everyone should contribute to make it a better place, with more responsibility on those in higher echelon.\nReality is complex and as any job, academic job is a mix of good, bad, joy, and tediuous. Sometimes it’s just the small acts of people around that consider your best interest at heart – see you as a person and not an expendable tool – that makes it worthwhile even if the system doesn’t work for you. I can’t say academia is bad when my colleague is considerate of me, telling me of a pathway so I can get a bigger office, and another colleague allocating himself the smaller office so a large office can be allocated to someone else (despite himself being a former head of department and a professor). There are some bad apples of course, but plenty of good people in academia.\nIf a workplace culture is bad or it’s not working well for you though, by all means walk away – maybe giving a reasonable chance to see if people take actions to rectify the issues first. In my relatively short career, I’ve butted heads a number of times already (concidentally all professors – yeah, I’m harder on people with power because I expect better of them) so I won’t be surprised a number of people dislike me, but also at the same time, I know there are plenty of people that appreciate me for my conduct and contributions. If anything, it’s the difficult times that can be revealing of character and bring people together. It’s always the people’s conduct that make the workplace great or not – or at least bearable.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nFestinger, L, and J M Carlsmith. 1959. “Cognitive Consequences of Forced Compliance.” Journal of Abnormal Psychology 58 (2): 203–10. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0041593.\n\n\nFestinger, Leon. 1957. “A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance.”"

This was actually one of the biggest reasons I wanted to switch from xaringan. All Rmd documents support Pandoc divs and spans except in xaringan where the markdown content is processed by remark.js instead of Pandoc. The lack of consistency even made me write my own naive javascript to mimic Pandoc div and span for xaringan, but I still wanted the native support.\nSo you can create a div element in Quarto revealjs by:\n::: myclass\n\nMy content.\n\n:::\nor equivalently,\n::: {.myclass}\n\nMy content.\n\n:::\nIn fact, it’s not limited to CSS classes but ids as well.

I won’t go into too much details this time, but the main thing is that a slide content is written within &lt;section&gt;&lt;/section&gt; and separate to this is a background element and other div (like footer and slide numbers). The latter elements are not nested within the slide itself, which makes the concept of applying the CSS class to the whole slide different in revealjs compared to xaringan/remarkjs.\nTo apply a CSS class to a slide with no title, you can do below:\n## {.myclass}\nand if you have a title, just write the title first before defining the class like below:\n## My title {.myclass}\nIf you want to apply it to the slide background then only specific attributes work, e.g. below changes the background color of the slide to red:\n## {background-color=\"red\"}"

    "section": "The grammar of experimental designs",
    "text": "The grammar of experimental designs\nThe so-called “The Grammar of Experimental Designs” is the title of my work-in-progress book found at emitanaka.org/edibble-book. More details can be found in the book, but briefly, the grammar of experimental designs is an object oriented programming system designed to capture elements of the origin of an experimental data encapsulated in a cognitive framework. It is an attempt to standardise the computational description of experimental components by fundamental terms so we are not lost in domain-specific jargon.\nThe motivation of the grammar of experimental designs is best explained by an analogy to the “grammar of graphics” (Wilkinson 2005) with its most popular implementation as ggplot2 (Wickham 2016) in the R language (R Core Team 2021). When we specify a plot, we can specify using a complete recipe. For example, the functions barplot() and pie() create a barplot and a pie chart, respectively, in the base R language – these functions are for a single purpose, nothing more.\n\ndata &lt;- data.frame(duty = c(\"teaching\", \"research\", \"admin\"),\n                   percentage = c(40, 40, 20))\n\nbarplot(data$percentage, names.arg = data$duty)\npie(data$percentage, labels = data$duty)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we specify plots using ggplot2, the system requires users to specify components of the plot, not the full plot. This not only gives greater control over the construction of the plot but it encourages the user to think about the relationship between data to plot elements. For example, below we create the pie chart and barplot using ggplot2. The first specification in ggplot2 is to initiate the object by ggplot() where the user can specify the data and the mapping of variable to plot aesthetic, then the user can append a layer like geom_col() to create a barplot. To construct a pie chart in ggplot2, the user must transform the default Cartesian coordinate system to a polar coordinate along one of the axis.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n# bar plot\nggplot(data, aes(x = duty, y = percentage)) +\n  geom_col() \n# pie chart\nggplot(data, aes(x = \"\", y = percentage, fill = duty)) +\n  geom_col() + \n  coord_polar(\"y\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ggplot2 system has a steep learning curve, however, the mastery of the system allows users to easily create a variety of plots. In a similar vein, the grammar of experimental designs is a system to construct experimental designs by experimental components – the users don’t need to specify the complete design but build up the experimental design by its basic components, like experimental units and treatments, giving them the flexibility in their thinking and specifciation of the experimental structure. The easiest way to grasp the grammar of experimental design is to see examples of its implementation as shown next."

    "text": "Constructing experimental designs with the edibble R package\nThe edibble package is a system in the R language to facilitate the design of comparative experiments based on the grammar of experimental designs. The package is available on Comprehensive R Arhive Network (CRAN) with the developmental version available at github.com/emitanaka/edibble and can be installed as below.\n\n# installing from CRAN\ninstall.packages(\"edibble\") \n# OR for the developmental version\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\") \nremotes::install_github(\"emitanaka/edibble\") \n\n\nPackage name\nThe name of the package, edibble, stands for the experimental design table or tibble for those that are familiar with tidyverse (Wickham et al. 2019). I often see people misspell it as eddible or edible (latter probably due to autocorrect), so I want to emphasise that is is edibble, i.e. one d and two b.\nThe package name itself relates to the aim of what it tries to produce, i.e. a table where columns specifies the unit and treatment factors in the experimental design and rows specify the characteristics of the observational unit, including the allocated treatment.\n\n\nExample usage\nLet’s suppose that we want to create a randomised complete block design (RCBD) with 6 blocks with 3 plots in each block to test 3 wheat varieties, labelled A, B and C. As not all of you may know what a RCBD is, to describe it more explicitly, the treatments (in this case the 3 wheat varieties) are randomly allocated to one of the plot (experimental unit) within a block; only one treatment level can be assigned to each plot; and each treatment level must appear exactly once in each block. The specification of this design in the edibble system is shown below and can be interpreted as follows:\n\nLine 1: load the library,\nLine 2: set the seed to ensure replication of the randomised design,\nLine 3: initialise the design object,\nLine 4-5: set the unit factors, namely 6 blocks and 3 plots nested in each block,\nLine 6: set the treatment factor, variety, with 3 levels (A, B, and C),\nLine 7: specify the high-level treatment to unit allocation,\nLine 8: assign the treatment randomly, and\nLine 9: the design specification is complete, now convert the result to a table.\n\n\nlibrary(edibble)\nset.seed(2022) \ndesign(\"Randomised Complete Block Design\") %&gt;% \n  set_units(block = 6,\n            plot = nested_in(block, 3)) %&gt;% \n  set_trts(variety = c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\")) %&gt;% \n  allot_trts(variety ~ plot) %&gt;% \n  assign_trts(\"random\") %&gt;% \n  serve_table()\n\n# Randomised Complete Block Design \n# An edibble: 18 x 3\n       block       plot  variety\n   &lt;unit(6)&gt; &lt;unit(18)&gt; &lt;trt(3)&gt;\n 1    block1     plot1         A\n 2    block1     plot2         B\n 3    block1     plot3         C\n 4    block2     plot4         A\n 5    block2     plot5         B\n 6    block2     plot6         C\n 7    block3     plot7         A\n 8    block3     plot8         C\n 9    block3     plot9         B\n10    block4     plot10        C\n11    block4     plot11        B\n12    block4     plot12        A\n13    block5     plot13        B\n14    block5     plot14        C\n15    block5     plot15        A\n16    block6     plot16        C\n17    block6     plot17        B\n18    block6     plot18        A\n\n\nAbove table output shows the resulting allocation of the treatment to units, e.g. from the first row we see that first plot in the first block is assigned variety A.\nNow consider the design specified below. How is this different to above?\n\ndesign(\"Do exam type matter?\") %&gt;% \n  set_units(school = 6,\n            student = nested_in(school, 3)) %&gt;% \n  set_trts(exam = c(\"Oral\", \"Written\", \"Computer\")) %&gt;% \n  allot_trts(exam ~ school) %&gt;% \n  assign_trts(\"random\") %&gt;% \n  serve_table()\n\n# Do exam type matter? \n# An edibble: 18 x 3\n      school    student     exam\n   &lt;unit(6)&gt; &lt;unit(18)&gt; &lt;trt(3)&gt;\n 1   school1  student1  Oral    \n 2   school1  student2  Oral    \n 3   school1  student3  Oral    \n 4   school2  student4  Computer\n 5   school2  student5  Computer\n 6   school2  student6  Computer\n 7   school3  student7  Oral    \n 8   school3  student8  Oral    \n 9   school3  student9  Oral    \n10   school4  student10 Written \n11   school4  student11 Written \n12   school4  student12 Written \n13   school5  student13 Computer\n14   school5  student14 Computer\n15   school5  student15 Computer\n16   school6  student16 Written \n17   school6  student17 Written \n18   school6  student18 Written \n\n\nFirst, you may have noticed that the experimental factors are named differently. The names that you enter in set_units() and set_trts() are not fixed by the system – the user may enter the name that is appropriate for their experimental context. These are just simply labels but it captures the valuable experimental context. In fact, the unit structure is exactly the same as the previous experiment! But it’s easy to see that the first experiment is a wheat variety trial but the second experiment is comparing the exam type across schools.\nSecond, aside from labels, you may have noticed everything is the same as the previous experiment except line 5. The treatment (exam type) are randomly allocated to schools, not individual students within a school. You can see this in the resulting table output – each school gets only one type of exam. The resulting design is in fact called a completely randomised design. Here, the experimental units are the schools and the intended observational units are the students.\nYou may think the edibble system is only for balanced designs (where there is equal number of units within a block), but you can easily specify unbalanced designs as shown in line 3-5 below where there are two blocks (labelled I and II) where block I has 3 plots and block II has 6 plots.\n\ndesign(\"Unbalanced design\") %&gt;% \n  set_units(block = c(\"I\", \"II\"),\n            plot = nested_in(block, \n                              \"I\" ~ 3,\n                             \"II\" ~ 6)) %&gt;% \n  set_trts(variety = c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\")) %&gt;% \n  allot_trts(variety ~ plot) %&gt;% \n  assign_trts(\"random\") %&gt;% \n  serve_table()\n\n# Unbalanced design \n# An edibble: 9 x 3\n      block      plot  variety\n  &lt;unit(2)&gt; &lt;unit(9)&gt; &lt;trt(3)&gt;\n1        I      plot1        B\n2        I      plot2        A\n3        I      plot3        C\n4        II     plot4        C\n5        II     plot5        A\n6        II     plot6        B\n7        II     plot7        C\n8        II     plot8        B\n9        II     plot9        A\n\n\nThere are more features in the edibble system. These features include setting responses using set_rcrds(), simulating responses with simulate_rcrds() (experimental only), and setting expectation of responses expect_rcrds(), e.g. when values should be positive numbers only. The latter allows files to be encoded with data validation rules, e.g. export_design() outputs the edibble table as an Excel file where values outside of expectation cannot be entered by exploiting Excel’s data validation system.\nThe edibble system has been designed so that developers can extend the system. If the assign_trts() is not suitable, then you can replace this with an alternative one. Likewise, if an Excel output is not desired then you can replace the exporting system with another system. The system exposes its components as modular functions to allow extensibility. The caveat of the edibble system is that there is a steep learning curve for both the user and the developer – but mastery of the grammar should help you flexibly specify a variety of experimental designs and deepen your thinking about the experimental design."

It does not choose from a menu of named designs.” – Bailey (2008)\n\nI highly discourage the use of named experimental designs, but I acknowledge that the literature is littered with them. The compromise I have made is to include a set of functions that are prefixed with menu_. For example, below menu_rcbd() shows the code to generate a RCBD with 3 treatments and 6 blocks. If you must take this approach, I suggest that you copy the output code and replace the generic factor names with what is appropriate in the context of your own experiment.\n\nmenu_rcbd(t = 3, r = 6)\n\ndesign(\"Randomised Complete Block Design\") %&gt;%\n  set_units(block = 6,\n            unit = nested_in(block, 3)) %&gt;%\n  set_trts(trt = 3) %&gt;%\n  allot_trts(trt ~ unit) %&gt;%\n  assign_trts(\"random\", seed = 424) %&gt;%\n  serve_table()\n\n\nIf you want to actually see a table output then you can takeout() any named design (on the menu). Say below menu_lsd() shows the code for generating a Latin Square design; the takeout() of this design on the menu shows the table output of the Latin Square design with 4 treatments.\n\ntakeout(menu_lsd(t = 4))\n\ndesign(\"Latin Square Design\") %&gt;%\n  set_units(row = 4,\n            col = 4,\n            unit = crossed_by(row, col)) %&gt;%\n  set_trts(trt = 4) %&gt;%\n  allot_trts(trt ~ unit) %&gt;%\n  assign_trts(\"random\", seed = 794) %&gt;%\n  serve_table() \n\n# Latin Square Design \n# An edibble: 16 x 4\n         row       col       unit      trt\n * &lt;unit(4)&gt; &lt;unit(4)&gt; &lt;unit(16)&gt; &lt;trt(4)&gt;\n 1      row1      col1     unit1      trt1\n 2      row2      col1     unit2      trt3\n 3      row3      col1     unit3      trt4\n 4      row4      col1     unit4      trt2\n 5      row1      col2     unit5      trt4\n 6      row2      col2     unit6      trt2\n 7      row3      col2     unit7      trt1\n 8      row4      col2     unit8      trt3\n 9      row1      col3     unit9      trt3\n10      row2      col3     unit10     trt4\n11      row3      col3     unit11     trt2\n12      row4      col3     unit12     trt1\n13      row1      col4     unit13     trt2\n14      row2      col4     unit14     trt1\n15      row3      col4     unit15     trt3\n16      row4      col4     unit16     trt4\n\n\nThe full list of available named experimental designs can be found in the Cookbook chapter in The Grammar of Experimental Designs book."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe design of an experiment is, without a doubt, of critical importance in the advancement of our knowledge. In fact, a good experimental design and well executed collection of data can eliminate or reduce the necessity of certain statistical analysis. The use of experimental designs in practice are arguably propagated by statistical software and interested readers can see Tanaka and Amaliah (2022) for a review of popular R packages in experimental design. The edibble R package is an attempt to specify designs by a paradigm that is flexible, yet human-centered. By building designs based on its components, users are required to think about the ingredients that make up the composition of the experimental structure – this system design I would hope translates to higher order thinking about experimental designs.\nThis article did not touch on much about optimal, adaptive, model-based nor domain-specific designs. The scope of work in the design of experiments is large and substantial work remain to bridge the gap between the principles and practice of experimental designs. Too often, teaching of experimental design is overshadowed by the analysis of experimental data and to get the most out of experimental data, we should remember that experimental context is invaluable in the design and no analysis can extract information from rubbish data."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Since I started working at the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics, Monash University in January 2020, I developed and taught across 4 units, totalling development of 36 unique 2-hour lectures, and developed an online resource on top of slide templates and utility scripts. The 3 units (Wild-Caught Data, Exploratory Data Analysis, and Communicating with Data) I taught were brand new units for the Master of Business Analytics and there were no past materials that I can leverage. The difficulty was compounded by the fact that my training was in classical statistics and almost all topics that I taught was actually never something I ever formally learnt. Needless to say it has been an absolutely exhausting time period! As much as I’m proud for surviving it, I hope to never repeat the experience again. I sacrificed a large quality of my life (particularly in 2020) just to finish developing my teaching materials. Fortunately or not, the series of lockdowns in Melbourne aided in giving me more time to focus on the development.\nTeaching Introduction to Machine Learning was the highlight of all the teaching for me. Not only did I enjoy teaching the content but it was also the first time I got to teach in-person at Monash after 3 years (gasp!). Shout out to the students who got up early each week for the Monday 9am lecture despite how cold it has become!\nI ended my last lecture (shown below) at Monash with the wrap-up for the Introduction to Machine Learning unit featuring the varied datasets and toolkits that was demonstrated in the unit. This would be the final lecture of the year for me but also the final lecture for me at Monash. From July 2023, I will be joining the Biological Data Science Institute at the Australian National University. As much as I enjoy teaching enthusiastic students and recognise the importance in training the next-generation, I hope I get more time to focus on research.\n\n\nSo what did I develop?

It took longer than what I had hoped to get the hexagon shape right. You may like to save your own time by downloading my powerpoint template here as a base to make your own.\nThe dimensions were set, as it is in hexSticker, so that you can print it according to http://hexb.in/sticker.html."

    "text": "Using copyright images in hex stickers\nIt’s worth noting about copyright of images since you may like to use images in your hex sticker. If you created the image on your own then the copyright in general will rest with you and there is no problem. If you borrow images from others, you may need to provide attribution depending on their license permission.\nIn hex stickers, you don’t really have a room to add citations so you may like to use those that require no attribution. For free ones, you can find these using sites such as flickr under Public Domain works (CC0).\nIt is a bit painful to consider copyright issues but it is important to give due credit, acknowledgement, attribution etc to the creator of the work. I’ve gone to great lengths at times to search for CC0 images or have paid for work. Afterall, creative work is valuable and should be properly rewarded.\nUPDATE 22/06 My sticker arrived! They are pretty good quality! I also got 16 which is more than the 10 sample they said on the website \n\nThese are from sticker mule. If you sign up with referral code here, both you and I will get some credit. You are, of course, welcomed to just go directly to the site to make the purchase.\n\nUPDATE 20/06/2021 When ordering an R-package hex sticker from sticker mule, I choose Stickers &gt; Die cut stickers &gt; Custom dimension of 1.73” x 1.99”."
