This was actually one of the biggest reasons I wanted to switch from xaringan. All Rmd documents support Pandoc divs and spans except in xaringan where the markdown content is processed by remark.js instead of Pandoc. The lack of consistency even made me write my own naive javascript to mimic Pandoc div and span for xaringan, but I still wanted the native support.\nSo you can create a div element in Quarto revealjs by:\n::: myclass\n\nMy content.\n\n:::\nor equivalently,\n::: {.myclass}\n\nMy content.\n\n:::\nIn fact, it’s not limited to CSS classes but ids as well. E.g.\n::: {#myid}\n\nMy content.\n\n:::\nis the same as\n<div id=\"myid\">\nMy content.\n</div>\nFor a span element in Quarto revealjs, it will be like below\n[My content.]{.myclass}\nwhere this is equivalent to below:\n<span class=\"myclass\">My content.</span>"

I won’t go into too much details this time, but the main thing is that a slide content is written within <section></section> and separate to this is a background element and other div (like footer and slide numbers). The latter elements are not nested within the slide itself, which makes the concept of applying the CSS class to the whole slide different in revealjs compared to xaringan/remarkjs.\nTo apply a CSS class to a slide with no title, you can do below:\n## {.myclass}\nand if you have a title, just write the title first before defining the class like below:\n## My title {.myclass}\nIf you want to apply it to the slide background then only specific attributes work, e.g. below changes the background color of the slide to red:\n## {background-color=\"red\"}"

For this, there is a special case where incremental lists can be specified by class “incremental” like below:\n::: {.incremental}\n- Task A\n- Task B\n:::\nMore details on incremental list can be found here."
