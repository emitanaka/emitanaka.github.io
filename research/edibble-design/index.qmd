 Experiments require human decisions in the design process, which in turn are reformulated and summarized as inputs into a system (computational or otherwise) to generate the experimental design. I leverage this system to promote a language of experimental designs by proposing a novel computational framework, called "the grammar of experimental designs", to specify experimental designs based on an object-oriented programming system that declaratively encapsulates the experimental structure. The framework aims to engage human cognition by building experimental designs with modular functions that modify a targeted singular element of the experimental design object. The syntax and semantics of the framework are built upon consideration from multiple perspectives. While the core framework is language-agnostic, the framework is implemented in the `edibble` R-package. A range of examples is shown to demonstrate the utility of the framework.
