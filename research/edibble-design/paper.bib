  abstract = {Intrinsic motivation (IM) is key for persistence at work. When they are intrinsically motivated, people experience work activities as an end in itself, such that the activity and its goal collide. The result is increased interest and enjoyment of work activities. In this article, we review the current state of knowledge on IM, including studies within organizational, cognitive, and social psychology. We distinguish our structural perspective, which defines IM as the overlap between means and ends (e.g., the means-ends fusion model), from content-based approaches to study IM. We specifically discuss three questions: ( a) What is IM and why does it matter, ( b) how can individuals and organizations increase IM, and ( c) what biases and misconceptions do employees and managers hold about IM?},

These tools are predesign experiment guide sheets to systematize the planning process and to produce organized written documentation. They also help experimenters discuss complex trade-offs between practical limitations and statistical preferences in the experiment. A case study involving the (computer numerical control) CNC-machining of jet engine impellers is included.},

An obvious starting point for buiding a model of what another knows is what one oneself, or thinks one knows. This article reviews evidence that people imput their own knowledge to others and that, although this serves them well in general, they often do so uncritically, with the result of erroneously assuming that other people have the same knowledge. Overimputation of one's own knowledge can contribute to communication difficulties. Corrective approaches are considered. A conceptualization of where own-knowledge imputation fits in the process of developing models of other people's knowledge is proposed.}

  abstract = {Field plot layouts are devised for planting two varieties (+ and -) juxtaposed so as to achieve measurement of the yield of each under identical conditions of spatial competition with the other. Use is made of the equal distance to nearest neighbors and honeycombing properties of hexagonal forms. The replication of a triangular layout at 600 intervals around a central plot is used to achieve balanced symmetry and replication in multiples of six. Yield can be measured on a plot surrounded by zero to six equally spaced competitors. A definition of "levelled" design is made to refer to the most nearly balanced number of replications of test hills per number of competitors.},
