It wasn't until the beginning of 2018 that I fully switched from Beamer/Powerpoint/Keynote^[I was never an `ioslides` or `revealjs` person (I have tried it but I didn't like it)] presentation slides  to using `xaringan`. Four years later, after over 120 `xaringan` slides^[Okay, I was surprised to count over 120 presentations but this includes all teaching slides too.] plus making a [whole theme](https://github.com/emitanaka/ninja-theme) for it, I started using [Quarto revealjs slides](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) instead from the start of 2022. So far I've given 5 talks with Quarto revealjs slides and I'm using it to make slides for the foreseeable future.\n",

From a philosophical view though, customising HTML slides requires you to know HTML, CSS, and/or JS, so after doing this process so many times, I've come to be better in HTML/CSS/JS.

        "`xaringan` is actually using [remark.js](https://github.com/gnab/remark) to render the slides. The development of remark.js started to become stagnant from about 2018, with the main author not as actively working on it. In the meanwhile, reveal.js had an expanding, active community with some fancy features. The `revealjs` R-package that ported reveal.js to Rmd, however, was clunky to do any serious customisation. I chose to use `xaringan` instead because customisation was more straight-forward, but the primary reason was that the main author Yihui was developing it. \n",
        "\n",
        "So why switch over to Quarto revealjs slides now? For me, this is because the Quarto team did a serious job implementing it and I figured out most of the equivalent features in `xaringan` for it. I share these below.\n",

This was actually one of the biggest reasons I wanted to switch from `xaringan`. All Rmd documents support Pandoc divs and spans **_except_** in `xaringan` where the markdown content is processed by remark.js instead of Pandoc. The lack of consistency even made me write [my own naive javascript to mimic Pandoc div and span](https://emitanaka.org/slides/ISIWSC2019/assets/pandoc.js) for `xaringan`, but I still wanted the native support.\n",
