Prior to 24th Jan 2021, my site was made using the blogdown R-package using the Hugo Academic Theme. At late 2020, the author of this theme rebranded this theme as Wowchemy and it seems to be moving in a direction that might not fit in well with me. I decided I wanted to have a simpler site and decided to use the distill R-package instead.
